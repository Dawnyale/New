            "I'm an artist at heart, and that's what sets me apart!" <br><br>You want to
            know why I'm a developer, because I want to create! This is my
            passion. The internet has become the new art gallery, and I want to
            be the viewer's favorite artist.

            I desire to work with other like-minded individuals because we all
            know two minds are better than one. I would love to provide my
            clients with the most efficient and aesthetically pleasing products
            possible. I'm a hard worker and I love what I do! When you mix these
            two together, the only outcome is..SUCCESS! Are you a creator and
            want to make something magical?

            This was my very first paid site! I had no idea how to code but was
            eager to get the job done. My client Anne reached out to me in
            desperate need of an updated website. She was currently using
            WordPress, so I went with that. I had never used WordPress before
            but learned all I needed to know over the next 3 days it took me
            to create the site. SHE LOVED IT! Though I didn't get paid much, I
            was happy to have the experience. Feel free to check out the
            finished product here:
